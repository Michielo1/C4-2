# 2023 Project group H-1-SE.4a | Chatbot application

 Summed up the most important requirements were:
 - A chatbot with a Dutch GUI
 - The chatbot should support Dutch & English
 - The application should be written with JavaFX

The application should still work and you can log in with admin as email and admin as password. Note that we made our application with both a self-hosted Alpaca models that will not work anymore, the AIML chatmodel should still be functional as this is within the project itself. Note that the Dutch AIML chatbot has limited support in comparison with the English AIML chatbot.
